# TASK: pygame Viking Edition — Full Transformation Plan

**Project:** pygame Viking Edition (hrabanazviking/pygame fork)  
**Session Start:** 2026-04-05  
**Collaborators:** Volmarr Wyrd + Runa Gridweaver Freyjasdottir  
**Branch:** development  
**Local Path:** `C:/Users/volma/runa/pygame`

---

## Vision Statement

Take the pygame library — the backbone of thousands of Python games and Raspberry Pi projects — and transform it into a modern, AI-native, 3D/VR-capable, vibe-coding-ready game engine foundation. Build the layer beneath H.E.R.E.T.I.C. and future NorseSagaEngine 3D expansion. Leave the code better, more robust, more capable, and more clearly structured than any version that came before it.

## Master Phase Plan

### PHASE 0 — Vibe Coding Foundation (Documentation & Structure)
> Goal: Make every part of this codebase legible to a vibe coding session. No file should be a black box.

**0A — Master Architecture Document** ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] `ARCHITECTURE.md` — complete systems overview (29 sections, all major systems with mermaid)

**0B — Per-File Structure Documents** ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] `docs/structure/` directory — 23 docs covering all C + Python + header files

**0C — Test Coverage Map** ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] `docs/TEST_MAP.md` — test file → module mapping, gap analysis

**0D — Build System Docs** ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] `docs/BUILD_SYSTEM.md` — full build system docs, platform notes, adding new C modules

**0E — API Surface Reference**
- [ ] `docs/API_SURFACE.md` — every public Python-facing symbol, with type stubs cross-reference

---

### PHASE 1 — Bug Audit & Hardening
> Goal: Make the code trustworthy. Every crash a past coder accepted as "just how it is" gets fixed.

**1A — Static Analysis Pass** ✓ COMPLETE
- [ ] Run `cppcheck` over all `src_c/` files — cppcheck not available on Windows; manual audit performed instead
- [x] Run `mypy` on `src_py/` — 4 findings, documented in AUDIT_REPORT.md
- [x] Run `pylint` on `src_py/` — 2 findings (platform-conditional imports in sysfont.py)
- [x] Document all findings in `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md`

**1B — C Safety Audit** ✓ COMPLETE (9 priority files)
- [x] Null pointer dereference audit — 6 null-deref bugs fixed (display×4, surface×1, image×1)
- [x] TTF resource check — font_init silent failure fixed (font×1)
- [ ] Integer overflow audit — not yet done (lower priority; blitters use controlled types)
- [ ] Buffer overflow audit — not yet done
- [ ] Use-after-free audit — not yet done (surface cleanup looks correct)
- [ ] Uninitialized variable audit — not yet done

**1C — Python Layer Safety** ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] `sprite.py` Generic base class — `Generic[TypeVar("T")]` → `_T = TypeVar("_T")` + `Generic[_T]`
- [x] `sysfont.py` platform-conditional imports — moved into function scope; pylint 10.00/10
- [x] `sysfont.py` type annotations — Sysfonts/Sysalias properly typed
- [x] `__init__.py` copyreg.pickle — `# type: ignore[arg-type]` on old-style API calls
- [ ] Broader type annotation pass on public functions — deferred to later phase

**1D — Memory Management Audit** ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] SDL2 resource leak check — 4 bugs fixed (display.c quit/error paths; transform.c rotozoom)
- [x] GIL handling — BEGIN/END pairs verified balanced in all key files
- [x] Refcount correctness — surface.c blits and subsurface chain verified correct

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1C)

**Phase 0 COMPLETE. Phase 1A–1D COMPLETE. HEAD: 0bf0150b**

1. **Phase 1E — Thread Safety:**
   - Verify mutex coverage completeness in event.c
   - Surface lock/unlock safety from non-main threads

2. **Phase 1F — Self-Healing Patterns:**
   - SDL_Init failure recovery paths
   - Error context enrichment

3. **Former Phase 1D items (done):**
   - Audit `SDL_DestroyTexture` / `SDL_DestroyRenderer` paths in `display.c`
   - FreeType face/cache lifecycle in `font.c` and `_freetype.c`

3. **Phase 1E — Thread Safety:**
   - Event filter mutex coverage verification
   - Surface lock/unlock from non-main thread safety

4. **Phase 1F — Self-Healing Patterns:**
   - SDL_Init failure recovery paths
   - Error context enrichment (SDL_GetError propagation)

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **This fork diverges from upstream.** If upstream pygame becomes active again, a diff/merge strategy will be needed. For now: our own version.
- **Backward compatibility is maintained through Phase 1-2.** Breaking changes (if any) are deferred to Phase 3+.
- **Phase 3 (AI) and Phase 4 (3D) can proceed in parallel** once Phase 0-2 are solid.
- **WYRD Protocol is the world model layer.** pygame Viking Edition renders it; WYRD owns the state.
- **H.E.R.E.T.I.C. is the first major target** for the complete stack (Phases 0-5 minimum before ship).
